# Science Data Portal (oar-sdp)

This repository provides the primary implementation of the NIST Science Data Portal (SDP) platform.  One of its main functions is to provide a modern web user interface for search and browsing of the NIST data products made available in the NIST Public Data Repository (PDR).

## Contents
```
angular    --> Angular (Typescript) source code
scripts    --> Tools for running the services and running all tests
oar-build  --> general oar build system support (do not customize)
docker/    --> Docker containers for building and running tests
```
## Prerequisites

As a Javascript/Typescript application, this product is built and run using node and npm. 
*	node 16.17.1 or higher

All prerequisite Javascript modules needed are provided via the npm build tool. See angular/package.json for a listing of primary dependencies and angular/package-lock.json for a complete listing of all dependencies.

## Building and Testing the software

### Simple Building with makedist

As a standard OAR repository, the software products can be built by simply via the makedist script, assuming the prerequisites are installed:
```
  scripts/makedist
```
The built products will be written into the dist subdirectory (created by the makedist); each will be written into a zip-formatted file with a name formed from the product name and a version string.

Additional options are available; use the -h option to view the details:
```
  scripts/makedist -h
```
### Simple Testing with testall

Assuming the prerequisites are installed, the testall script can be used to execute all unit and integration tests:
```
  scripts/testall
```
Like with makedist, you can run the tests for the different products separately by listing the desired product names as arguments to testall. Running testall -h will explain available command-line options.

### Building and Testing Using Native Tools

The makedist and testall scripts are simply wrappers around the native build tools for the products--namely, npm. You can use these tools directly to build and test. Consult the README.md files in the angular directory for more details.

### Building and Testing Using Docker

Like all standard OAR repositories, this repository supports the use of Docker to build the software and run its tests. (This method is used at NIST in production operations.) The advantage of the Docker method is that it is not necessary to first install the prerequisites; this are installed automatically into Docker containers.

To build the software via a docker container, use the makedist.docker script:
```
  scripts/makedist.docker
```
Similarly, testall.docker runs the tests in a container:
```
  scripts/testall.docker
```
Like their non-docker counterparts, these scripts accept product names as arguments.

## Running the services

Consult the README.md files in the angular directory for details on how to launch the services provided by the software products.

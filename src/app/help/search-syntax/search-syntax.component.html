  <h1>Search Syntax</h1>
  <hr/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>These rules govern the syntax for a search typed into the SDP search box.</p>
    <ol class="sr">
      <li>A query is made up of a series of tokens delimited (in the absense of quotes) by one or more spaces. A
        pair of quotes (containing other text) delimits a single token.&nbsp; An unpaired quote is taken a
        literal quote character that does not affect the delimiting of tokens.
      </li>
      <li>Each token represents a constraint on the query; the format determines the type of query:
        <ol class="sr">
          <li>single word &ndash; this is interpreted as a term to be matched to any word in the record</li>
          <li>quoted phrase &ndash; the characters between the quotes are treated as a phrase that must appear
            exactly in the record in order to match
          </li>
          <li><em>and</em>, <em>AND</em>, <em>or</em>, <em>OR</em> &ndash; these literal words correspond to
            constraint joining operators (see 3.)
          </li>
          <li>key=value &ndash; this is interpreted as constraint against a specific field in the record.
            <ol class="sr">
              <li>The value is either a single word or a quoted phrase</li>
              <li>For a record to match, the field given by key must contain the value.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <li>The constraints are joined together as follows:*
        <ol class="sr">
          <li>All single words and quoted phrase constraints (2.2) are joined together via a space (which means
            AND in this context) and set as the value to the searchphrase constraint.*
            <ol class="sr">
              <li>*this is a current limitation of the RMM service</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If a joining operator token appears between two other tokens, those constraints are joined by that
            logical operator.
            <ol class="sr">
              <li>AND, and &ndash; intrepreted as a logical AND of the two constraints</li>
              <li>OR, or &ndash; interpreted as a logical OR of the two constraints</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Two non-joining operator tokens next to each other are implicitly joined by a logical OR. <br/>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

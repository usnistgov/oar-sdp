        The Science Data Portal provides an advanced query building feature for more specifically directed searches to the underlying NIST public data repository records through a web interface.    Through the Advanced Search Builder interface,  users have the capability of constructing a query and if desired,  saving this in their browser cache.     To create an Advanced Query,   the user must first Click on the + Create Query as shown below.

        Selecting the <b>+Create New Field</b> will open up a query construction table for entering query field constraints and values.  The query construction table allows a user to select a <b>Field Type</b> from a drop down list of field names,  and enter the value in the <b>Field Text</b> box.               </p>

        The figure below provides and example of building a query using the construction table.   A user can select the <b>Field Type</b> from the drop down box, e.g. Contact’s Full Name ,   then type in the interested search value,  e.g. “Scott”,  in <b>Field Text</b> box.   The Query will automatically be populated in the main Search box in the top middle of the page.    Multiple fields can be queried by selecting the Action button to add another row,  i.e. another field.  The example below shows that there can be a combined query with the Contact Name and a keyword,  e.g. “nanotechnology”.    Similarly,   fields may be removed from the query by Selecting the Action remove button to the right of the row.                  </p>

        Learning from the patterns using the Advanced Search Builder,   in addition to the <b>Search Query Rules</b>,   users may enter their advanced query directly in the Search box.   Users may also Save their queries for future use by selecting the Save button below the Query construction table.   The user may name their query,   save it,   and then it will appear in the Queries table on the left side for future selection or modification.  The saved query will remain available through the application browser window until the user browser cache is cleared.  A Saved Query will show in the top banner with a count.              </p>

        To execute the Advanced Query,   a user should click on the main <b>Search</b> button to see the results.   Upon execution the search results page listing will appear.

        A user can go directly to their query by selecting on Queries and then selecting the More button to go to the query builder interface.    An existing query may be modified,  deleted or saved again to change the field value and conduct additional searches.              </p>

        "description": "The NIST Chemical Kinetics Database includes essentially all reported kinetics results for thermal gas-phase chemical reactions. The database is designed to be searched for kinetics data based on the specific reactants involved, for reactions resulting in specified products, for all the reactions of a particular species, or for various combinations of these. In addition, the bibliography can be searched by author name or combination of names. The database contains in excess of 38,000 separate reaction records for over 11,700 distinct reactant pairs. These data have been abstracted from over 12,000 papers with literature coverage through early 2000. Rate constant records for a specified reaction are found by searching the Reaction Database. All rate constant records for that reaction are returned, with a link to 'Details' on that record. Each rate constant record contains the following information (as available): Reactants and, if defined, reaction products; Rate parameters: A, n, Ea/R, where k = A* (T/298)**n exp[-(Ea/R)/T], where T is the temperature in Kelvins; Uncertainty in A, n, and Ea/R, if reported; Temperature range of experiment or temperature range of validity of a review or theoretical paper; Pressure range and bulk gas of the experiment; Data type of the record (i.e., experimental, relative rate measurement, theoretical calculation, modeling result, etc.). If the result is a relative rate measurement, then the reaction to which the rate is relative is also given; Experimental procedure, including separate fields for the description of the apparatus, the time resolution of the experiment, and the excitation technique. A majority of contemporary chemical kinetics methods are represented. The Kinetics Database is being expanded to include other resources for the convenience of the users. Presently this includes direct links to the corresponding NIST WebBook page for all substances for which such a link is possible. This is indicated by underling and highlighting the species. The WebBook provides thermodynamic, spectral, and other data on the species. Note that the link to the WebBook is opened as a new frame in your browser.",

In this method, all chemical compounds are annotated in terms of standard chemical structural fragments. These fragments are then organized into a data tree based on their chemical substructures. Search engines have been developed to use this data tree. These search engines use the Chem-BLAST technique to search on the fragments and look for their chemical structural neighbors. The technique was originally developed in the context of the HIV Structural database to enable a query on inhibitors of HIV protease. (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/hivsdb/hivsdb.html.) Recently the method has been significantly improved to extend to the ligands found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). (See http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.html.)  The method establishes a tree-like relationship between the rings found in three-letter codes that denote ligands of the structures found in the PDB. Semantic Web relations are established between the structural scaffolds of the ligands and organizes them in an XML database utilizing the Web's Resource Description Framework (RDF). An Adobe Flex-based interface is used to present this information on the Web. Plans are under way to extend this work to non-ring type scaffolds as well. Chem-BLAST has also been extended to structures in PubChem. http://xpdb.nist.gov/chemblast/pdb.pl which includes several non-ring standard reused groups such as sulfates. Efforts are under way to use the underlying principles of Chem-BLAST to enable query on non-structural data, such as cell image data http://xpdb.nist.gov/cell/image.pl.",

The database contains physical data required for quantitative interpretation of an electron spectrum for a specimen with a given composition. Retrieval of relevant data is performed by a small expert system [1-3] that queries the comprehensive databases. A simulation module is also available within SESSA that provides an estimate of peak intensities as well as the energy and angular distribution of the emitted electron flux. The information needed by the expert system to accomplish its task closely matches instrument settings made by an experimenter when actually performing a measurement and is complemented by an initial estimate of the sample composition.",

These BCFs are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on two models of electron transport in the material, a simplified model and an advanced model. One assumption for the former model is that the primary-electron beam is unchanged, in intensity, energy or direction, within the information depth for Auger-electron emission. This assumption becomes progressively less useful as the primary energy becomes closer to the core-level ionization energy for the relevant Auger transition or for increasing angles of incidence of the primary electrons.",

The current release includes 43,406 crystal entries, up from 14,372 in the previous release. The new data have been extracted from PDB REMARK 280 records. The data have been converted into scientific format (from aggregate text string to individual, numeric data) with error checking and standardization of chemical names. New search features include automatic synonym searches, numeric range searches for macromolecular concentration, pH, temperature, resolution, and year of publication, and combined searches over multiple fields  Version 4.03",

Spectra are provided on a CD-ROM in the JCAMP-DX (Joint Committee for Atomic and Molecular Physical Data 'Data Exchange') format. Chemical structures are provided in the MOL-file format. The IR data originated from two sources, from the so-called 'EPA Vapor-Phase IR Library' and from NIST laboratories. The data have been sub-divided in two ways: 1) as concatenated JCAMP and SDF files (concatenated MOL-files) and 2) in individual files where each spectrum and structure is provided in a separate JCAMP and MOL file, using file names containing the CAS registry number of the compound.  Important Note: All spectra were measured in the gas phase by GC/IR (gas chromatography/infrared spectroscopy), hence concentrations in the IR cell are not known or estimable. Molar absorption coefficients are not reported. This data provides only relative absorption coefficients as a function of wavelength which can be used for identification, not quantification.",

        "description": "NIST has accumulated a valuable and comprehensive collection of thermal conductivity data from measurements performed with a 200-mm square guarded-hot-plate apparatus. The guarded-hot-plate test method is arguably the most accurate and popular method for determination of thermal transmission properties of flat, homogeneous specimens under steady state conditions. Several organizations, including ASTM and ISO, have standardized the method.   Version 1.0 of the database includes data for over 2000 measurements, covering several categories of materials including concrete, fiberboard, plastics, thermal insulation, and rubber. The data cover a temperature range corresponding to most building applications; however, the majority of the measurements were conducted at 24Â° C (75Â° F).  Web version 1.0",

        "description": "ThermoData Engine is the first product fully implementing all major principles of the concept of dynamic data evaluation formulated at NIST/TRC. This concept requires the development of large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all 'raw' experimental data known to date with detailed descriptions of relevant metadata and uncertainties. The combination of these databases with expert software designed to generate recommended data based on available 'raw' experimental data and their uncertainties leads to the possibility of producing data compilations automatically 'to order' forming a dynamic data infrastructure. The NIST/TRC SOURCE data archival system, currently containing more than 5.0 million experimental data points, is used in conjunction with ThermoData Engine as a comprehensive storage facility for experimental thermophysical and thermochemical property data. Currently, this database contains property data for more than 21,000 pure compounds.  The scope of the NIST Standard Reference Database 103a is pure compounds only.   The ThermoData Engine (TDE) software incorporates all major stages of the concept implementation, including data retrieval, grouping, normalization, sorting, consistency enforcement, fitting, and prediction for all major thermophysical properties (about 50 properties total) including density, vapor pressure, heat capacity, enthalpies of phase transitions, critical properties, melting and boiling points, etc. The ThermoData Engine fills the gaps in experimental data by deployment of automated group-contribution and corresponding-states property predictions, emphasizes enforcement of consistency between related properties (including those obtained from predictions), provides for flexibility in selection of default data models depending on the particular data scenario, incorporates a large variety of models for secondary fitting, and allows saving of critically evaluated data in ThermoML format. TDE supports several equations of state for pure compounds (original and modified volume-translated Peng-Robinson, Sanchez-Lacombe, PC-SAFT, and Span-Wagner) and allows the user to fit parameters to experimental and predicted data. Enthalpies of formation are evaluated on the basis of stored experimental enthalpies of combustion and modified Benson group-contribution method. ThermoML output assures compatibility of the ThermoData Engine with any engineering application equipped with a ThermoML software 'reader'. Periodical Web updates of the local TDE-SOURCE database maintain its up-to-date status, providing new data to users of TDE soon after original publication in the literature.    System Requirements: PC with Microsoft Windows XP,Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2012. At least 2 GBytes of memory is recommended.",

Included in this table are new values not previously tabulated in either publication. The references are given for these values. Values revised since NBS Special Publication 626 for the half lives of various 'short-lived' radionuclides arise from improved impurity analysis, incorporation of additional data from new sources, and re-evaluation of old data. Values in common usage in certificates and reports are available from the National Nuclear Data Center (http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/). In case of discrepant data, the NIST value is recommended.",

' The ITRS indicates that continuing research is needed to obtain experimental data for 'transport and thermal constants.' This Project will generate transport and thermodynamic property data for the gases used in semiconductor processing. The data will be useful for equipment modeling in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes and the data will also provide a rational basis for the calibration of mass flow controllers (MFCs) used to meter process gases.  NIST is measuring the thermophysical properties of the process gases, the 'surrogate' gases, and binary mixtures of process and carrier gases. The process gases are used in CVD and the surrogate gases are used to calibrate MFCs. The results will be disseminated in this data base providing the heat capacity, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and the virial coefficients for the virial equation of state providing the pressure-density-temperature relation for the process gases.",

        "description": "This Standard Reference Database consists of methods for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry on a wide variety of synthetic polymers. The methods are taken from the peer-review scientific literature. The database covers the period from 1988, the year of Tanaka's first paper on the subject, through 2011. Each recipe comes with a literature citation and associated digital object identifier (DOI) when available. The database currently contains entries for over 1250 polymer/matrix combinations.   These methods have not necessarily been tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), nor does NIST claim the database to be a comprehensive list of all methods to be found in the open literature. This database is provided solely as a resource for the mass spectroscopy community.   All polymers are sorted into five main groups:  A - polymers containing carbon and hydrogen only   B - polymers containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (but not nitrogen)  C - polymers containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (oxygen may also be present)  D - polymers containing sulfur, phosphorous, or halides  E - polymers containing one or more of: silicon, germanium, tin, or metals   Within these groups, the polymers are further sorted into classes according to 'Glossary of Class Names of Polymers Based on Chemical Structure and Molecular Architecture (IUPAC Recommendations 2009)' Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 81, No. 6, pp. 1131-1186, 2009. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/PAC-REC-08-01-30. Not every IUPAC class contains a MALDI recipe. This occurs for a number of reasons, but primarily because there are no published methods for many classes.   The database is organized by main chain chemistry. Copolymers can be found under all classes represented by repeat units in their main chain. End group and chair architecture information is available but not as a sortable field. There are entries for dendrimers, nanoparticles, polysaccharides, and homopolymer polypeptides, but the database has significantly less coverage in these areas. The database could be extended into these areas if there is significant community interest.   Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number are provided for all matrices having them. Links to the NIST Chemistry WebBook are available for all matrices having a WebBook entry. The WebBook provides thermophysical, structural, and spectroscopic information a wide variety of compounds.",

This concept requires the development of large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all 'raw' experimental data known to date with detailed descriptions of relevant metadata and uncertainties. The combination of these databases with expert software designed to generate recommended data based on available 'raw' experimental data and their uncertainties leads to the possibility of producing data compilations automatically 'to order' forming a dynamic data infrastructure. The NIST/TRC SOURCE data archival system, currently containing more than 5.0 million experimental data points, is used in conjunction with ThermoData Engine as a comprehensive storage facility for experimental thermophysical and thermochemical property data. Currently, this database contains property data for more than 21,000 pure compounds, 42,500 binary mixtures, 11,500 ternary mixtures, and 6,000 chemical reactions. The scope of the NIST Standard Reference Database 103b is pure compounds, binary mixtures, ternary mixtures, and chemical reactions. The ThermoData Engine (TDE) software incorporates all major stages of the concept implementation, including data retrieval, grouping, normalization, sorting, consistency enforcement, fitting, and prediction for all major thermophysical properties (about 120 properties total) including density, vapor pressure, heat capacity, enthalpies of phase transitions, critical properties, melting and boiling points, etc. The ThermoData Engine fills the gaps in experimental data by the deployment of the automated group-contribution and corresponding-states property prediction, emphasizes enforcement of consistency between related properties, provides for flexibility in selection of default data models depending on the particular data scenario, incorporates a large variety of models for secondary fitting, and allows saving of critically evaluated data in the ThermoML format. TDE supports several equations of state for pure compounds and allows user to fit their parameters to experimental and predicted data. Enthalpies of formation are evaluated on the basis of stored experimental enthalpies of combustion and modified Benson group-contribution method. ThermoML output assures compatibility of the ThermoData Engine with any engineering application equipped with a ThermoML software 'reader'. Periodical Web updates of the local TDE-SOURCE database maintain its up-to-date status, providing new data to users of TDE soon after original publication in the literature. TDE provides access to single-phase thermodynamic and transport property data, VLE, LLE, and SLE data, and does automated evaluation of most of those properties. Certain properties such as densities, critical, and transport properties are described by special fitting equations; phase equilibria data are described by activity coefficient models selected by the user. UNIFAC predictions are generated for mixtures covered by the various versions of the UNIFAC method, including NIST-modified UNIFAC model. Phase diagrams, isotherms, and isobars based on those models can be calculated and drawn for the user'?Â¿s convenience. Proprietary data can be entered for inclusion in the evaluation, and the user can influence the evaluation process by changing relative data weights or by rejecting particular data sets. TDE is capable to evaluate thermophysical properties and their uncertainties for multi-component material streams. TDE supports evaluation of the thermodynamic properties of chemical reactions such as enthalpies, entropies, Gibbs free energies, and equilibrium constants based on available experimental data as well as group contribution methods. System Requirements: PC with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2003/2008/2012. At least 2 GB of memory is recommended.",

With each image is a file that contains the textual content of the page.  The images and associated text can be used to evaluate alternative DAR technologies, and they can be used in IR experiments where retrieval performance can be compared between retrieving the pages of text provided with the database and retrieving the corresponding text produced by DAR. In this way,  the  impact  of recognition  errors  on retrieval  performance  can  be  evaluated  (a key  goal of METTREC).",

        "description": "The purpose of this project is to improve the accuracy of statistical software by providing reference datasets with certified computational results that enable the objective evaluation of statistical software.   Currently datasets and certified values are provided for assessing the accuracy of software for univariate statistics, linear regression, nonlinear regression, and analysis of variance. The collection includes both generated and 'real-world' data of varying levels of difficulty. Generated datasets are designed to challenge specific computations. These include the classic Wampler datasets for testing linear regression algorithms and the Simon & Lesage datasets for testing analysis of variance algorithms. Real-world data include challenging datasets such as the Longley data for linear regression, and more benign datasets such as the Daniel & Wood data for nonlinear regression. Certified values are 'best-available' solutions. The certification procedure is described in the web pages for each statistical method.   Datasets are ordered by level of difficulty (lower, average, and higher). Strictly speaking the level of difficulty of a dataset depends on the algorithm. These levels are merely provided as rough guidance for the user. Producing correct results on all datasets of higher difficulty does not imply that your software will pass all datasets of average or even lower difficulty. Similarly, producing correct results for all datasets in this collection does not imply that your software will do the same for your particular dataset. It will, however, provide some degree of assurance, in the sense that your package provides correct results for datasets known to yield incorrect results for some software.   The Statistical Reference Datasets is also supported by the Standard Reference Data Program.",

This official U.S. time is the NIST estimate of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and called UTC(NIST). The accuracy of UTC(NIST) as distributed through the Internet Time Service (ITS) is on the order of 0.001 seconds (one millisecond), although accuracy can vary depending on network conditions and other parameters. \r\n\r\n Note that unlike most traditional datasets, time is intrinsically a transient, ever-changing quantity. As soon as UTC(NIST) is transmitted to a client, that particular value of UTC(NIST) no longer reflects the current time, which is constantly changing. There is thus no static storage of any time data, apart from internal diagnostic information not released to the public which ensures that UTC(NIST) as disseminated through the Internet Time Service (ITS) is commensurate with the official UTC(NIST) realization within the uncertainties of the system. \r\n\r\n  The vast majority of UTC(NIST) information distributed through ITS is provided freely, anonymously and automatically to the public. Any IP address can request UTC(NIST) through the ITS and the information is automatically and anonymously provided at no cost to the user. Full documentation of the ITS including all the source code is available to the public through the web site http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/. \r\n\r\n NIST provides an authenticated version of ITS to a limited number of users (approximately 500 users near the end of calendar year 2015) who for various reasons want to ensure they are receiving UTC(NIST) without spoofing or interference with the information. This service uses public key encryption for the set of registered users to provide authenticated UTC(NIST). ",

For example, while the certificates and data objects on most, if not all, cards issued today are signed using RSA PKCS #1 v1.5, the set of test cards include examples of certificates and data objects that are signed using each of the algorithms and key sizes listed in Table 3-3 of Special Publication 800-78-3, including RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA. Similarly, the infrastructure supporting the test cards provides examples of CRLs and OCSP responses that are signed using each of these signature algorithms. The set of test cards also includes certificates with elliptic curve subject public keys in addition to RSA subject public keys, as is permitted by Table 3-1 of Special Publication 800-78-3. The set of test cards, collectively, also include all of the mandatory and optional data objects listed in Section 3 of SP 800-73-3 Part 1, except for Cardholder Iris Images. Several of the cards include a Key History object along with retired key management keys.",

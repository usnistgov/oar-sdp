These data were generated in order to determine the average feature sizes based on optical scattering, which is an inverse problem for which solutions to the forward problem are calculated using electromagnetic simulations after a parameterization of the feature geometry. Here, the array of features measured and modeled is periodic in one-dimension (i.e., a line grating) with a nominal line width of 100 nm placed at 300 nm intervals, or pitch = 300 nm; the short-hand label for the features is \"L100P300.\" The entirety of the modeled data is included, over two thousand simulations that are indexed using a top, middle, and bottom linewidth as floating parameters.  Two subsets of these data, featuring differing sampling strategies, are also provided.  This data set also contains angle-resolved optical measurements with uncertainties for nine arrays which differ in their dimensions due to lithographic variations using a focus/exposure matrix, as identified in a previous publication (https://doi.org/10.1117/12.777131). We have previously reported line widths determined from these measurements based upon non-linear regression to compare theory to experiment.  Machine learning approaches are to be fostered for solving such inverse problems.  Data are formatted for direct use in \"Model-Based Optical Metrology in R: MoR\" software which is also available from data.nist.gov. (https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1426859).

Successful introduction of such materials is hampered by the lack of a quantitative understanding of process-structure-property relationships. These relationships are developed through the detailed characterization of nanoscale reinforcement morphology within the embedding medium. We reveal the three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale morphology of high volume fraction (Vf) aligned CNT/epoxy-matrix nanocomposites using energy-filtered electron tomography. We present an automated phase-identification method for fast, accurate, representative rendering of the CNT spatial arrangement in these low-contrast bimaterial systems. The resulting nanometer-scale visualizations provide quantitative information on the evolution of CNT morphology and dispersion state with increasing Vf, including network structure, CNT alignment, bundling and waviness. The CNTs  exhibit a nonlinear increase in bundling and alignment and a decrease in waviness as a function of increasing Vf. Our findings explain previously observed discrepancies between the modeled and measured trends in bulk mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. The techniques we have developed for morphological quantitation are applicable to many low-contrast material systems.","We use new, nanoscale quantitative 3D morphological information and stochastic modeling to re-interpret experimental measurements of continuous aligned carbon nanotube (A-CNT) PNC properties as a function of A-CNT packing/volume fraction. The 3D tortuosity calculated from tomographic reconstructions and its evolution with Vf is used to develop a novel definition of waviness that incorporates the stochastic nature of CNT growth. The importance of using randomly wavy CNTs to model these materials is validated by agreement between simulated and previously-measured PNC elastic moduli. Secondary morphological descriptors such as CNT-CNT junction density and inter-junction distances are measured for transport property predictions. The scaling of the junction density with CNT volume fraction is observed to be non-linear, and this non-linearity is identified as the reason behind the previously unexplained scaling of aligned-CNT PNC longitudinal thermal conductivity. The measured electrical conductivity scales linearly with Vf as it is relatively insensitive to junction density beyond percolation."],"contactPoint":{"hasEmail":"mailto:james.liddle@nist.gov","fn":"James Alexander Liddle"},"doi":"doi:10.18434/mds2-2344","keyword":["TEM","tomography","carbon nanotube composite","nanocomposite","CNT"],"ediid":"ark:/88434/mds2-2344","components":[{"accessURL":"https://doi.org/10.18434/mds2-2344","@id":"#doi:10.18434/mds2-2344","@type":["nrd:Hidden","dcat:Distribution"]},{"description":"This zip file contains the raw and processed image files from a series of vertically-aligned carbon nanotube/epoxy composites.

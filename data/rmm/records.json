The data provided in the site are from collections maintained by the NIST Standard Reference Data Program and outside contributors. Data in the WebBook system are organized by chemical species. The WebBook system allows users to search for chemical species by various means. Once the desired species has been identified, the system will display data for the species.  Data include thermochemical properties of species and reactions, thermophysical properties of species, and optical, electronic and mass spectra."],"language":["en"],"bureauCode":["006:55"],"contactPoint":{"hasEmail":"mailto:peter.linstrom@nist.gov","@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Peter Linstrom"},"accessLevel":"public","@id":"ark:/88434/mds0021drk","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Institute of Standards and Technology"},"doi":"doi:10.18434/T4D303","keyword":["IR spectrum","InChI","InChIKey","UV Vis spectrum","boiling point","chemical data","chemical structure","enthalpy","entropy","heat capacity","heat of formation","ionization potential","mass spectrum","gas chromatography","retention index","thermochemical data","thermochemistry","thermodynamic data","vapor pressure","reaction thermochemistry","electronic and vibrational spectra","constants of diatomic molecules","ion energetics","appearance energy","electron affinity","proton affinity","gas basicity","thermophysical fluid property data","thermal conductivity","sound speed"],"license":"https://www.nist.gov/open/license","modified":"2017-06-21","ediid":"EBC9DB05EDEE5B0EE043065706812DF85","components":[{"accessURL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.18434/T4D303","@id":"#doi:10.18434/T4D303","mediaType":"text/html","@type":["nrd:Hidden","dcat:Distribution"]}],"@type":["nrd:SRD","nrdp:PublicDataResource"]}]}

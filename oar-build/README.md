# oar-build: Build tools for the OAR Platform

The contents of this directory originate from [the oar-build
repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/oar-build).  It contains
tools for building an OAR package.  (See
[../README_OARBUILD.md](https://github.com/usnistgov/oar-build/blob/master/README_OARBUILD.md)
for information about these tools.)

This directory contains scripts and related data that can be called
internally by a package's build scripts (found in
[../scripts](../scripts) and [../docker](../docker)).  Files in this
directory generally should not by edited; instead, one customizes the
wrapper scripts that reside in the aforementioned directories.

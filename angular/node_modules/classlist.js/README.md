classList.js is a cross-browser JavaScript shim that fully implements `element.classList`. Refer to [the MDN page on `element.classList`][1] for more information.

This works in every browser except IE 7 or earlier.

An older version is hosted at public CDNs, allowing you to use this already small file at nearly zero size overhead. Use one of these URLs:

  - [//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/classlist/2014.01.31/classList.min.js](//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/classlist/2014.01.31/classList.min.js)
  - [//cdn.jsdelivr.net/classlist/2014.01.31/classList.min.js](//cdn.jsdelivr.net/classlist/2014.01.31/classList.min.js)

If you would like other versions (such as the current one) hosted there, follow the instructions at

to prepare a pull request.
